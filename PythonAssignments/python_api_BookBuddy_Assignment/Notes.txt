In VS code:
    python -m venv venv

    venv\Scripts\activate

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    python initialize_db.py

    python main.py

In cmd:
    sqlite3 books.db

    SELECT * FROM books;

- SQLite database (via SELECT * FROM books) and the data returned by the API (http://127.0.0.1:5000/books) are not synchronized.

- This happens when the database in use by the API is different from the one we're inspecting via the command line.

In post-man:

Get: http://127.0.0.1:5000/books

POST: http://127.0.0.1:5000/books

PUT: http://127.0.0.1:5000/books/id

DELETE: http://127.0.0.1:5000/books/id
