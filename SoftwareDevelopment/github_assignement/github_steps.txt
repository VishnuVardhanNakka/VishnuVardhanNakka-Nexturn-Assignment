1. Project Initialization
    # Your team has asked you to set up version control for a new project locally and link it to a GitHub repository.

    - Create a Local Git Repository:
        mkdir sample-project
        cd sample-project
        git init

    - Create a Remote Repository on GitHub:
        Log in to GitHub.
        Create a new repository named sample-project.

    - Link the Local Repository to GitHub:
        git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/sample-project.git

2. Feature Addition: 
    # A new feature requires you to add a README.md file that contains an introduction to the project. The file should include: 
    # The project name. 
    # A brief description of the project. 

    - Create the README.md File:
        echo "# Sample Project" > README.md
        echo "This project serves as a foundation for Git and GitHub workflow training." >> README.md

    - Add and Commit the Changes:
        git add README.md
        git commit -m "Add README.md with project introduction"

3. Branch Management
    # To add the README.md file, you must create a new branch called feature/update-readme. 
    # After completing the changes, you need to push the branch to the remote repository for review by your team.
    
    - Create a New Branch:
        git branch feature/update-readme
        git checkout feature/update-readme
    
    - Push the Feature Branch to GitHub:
        git push -u origin feature/update-readme

4. Merge Changes: 
    # Once the feature branch is reviewed, you must merge it into the main branch and ensure that the changes are reflected in the remote repository.
    
    - Switch Back to the Main Branch:
        git checkout main
    
    - Merge the Feature Branch:
        git merge feature/update-readme

    - Push Changes to GitHub:
        git push origin main

5. Branch Cleanup: 
    # After the merge, the feature/update-readme branch is no longer needed. Your team has instructed you to delete it both locally and remotely.
    
    - Delete the Branch Locally:
        git branch -d feature/update-readme

    - Delete the Branch Remotely:
        git push origin --delete feature/update-readme


Deliverables
    GitHub Repository:
        A repository named sample-project containing the project.
    Feature Branch:
        A branch named feature/update-readme with the README.md file added.
    Merged Main Branch:
        The README.md file merged into the main branch.
    Cleaned Branches:
        The feature/update-readme branch deleted locally and remotely.


Key Questions and Answers: 
    1. How will you set up the project for version control and push it to GitHub? 
        git init
        git commit -m "Initial commit"
        git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/sample-project.git
        git push -u origin master  # or 'main' if your branch is named 'main'

    2. What steps will you take to create, push, and manage branches effectively? 
        git checkout -b feature/update-readme
        echo "# Sample Project" > README.md
        echo "This project serves as a foundation for Git and GitHub workflow training." >> README.md
        git add README.md
        git commit -m "Add README.md with project introduction"
        git push -u origin feature/update-readme

    3. How will you ensure the changes in the feature branch are merged into the main 
    branch? 
        git checkout main
        git merge feature/update-readme
        git push origin main

    4. What commands will you use to clean up unused branches locally and 
    remotely?
        - Delete the branch locally:
            git branch -d feature/update-readme
        - Delete the branch remotely:
            git push origin --delete feature/update-readme
