Case Study 2: Expense Tracker Application 
Scenario 
	A startup founder wants a personal expense tracker to monitor their daily spending. 
	The application should allow users to log expenses, categorize them, and visualize the total spending in different categories. 

Requirements 
	1. Features: 
		o Add a new expense with details like: 
			▪ Amount. 
			▪ Description. 
			▪ Category (e.g., Food, Travel, Shopping). 
		o Display a summary of total spending by category. 
		o Delete expenses if needed. 
	
	2. Styling: 
		o Create a visually pleasing layout with CSS (e.g., category badges, table layout for expense logs). 
		o Use media queries to ensure the design is responsive on mobile and desktop screens. 
	
	3. JavaScript Functionality: 
		o Use JavaScript to calculate and display the total expense for each category dynamically. 
		o Store expenses using localStorage for persistence. 
	
	4. Extras (Optional): 
		o Create a pie chart or bar chart to visualize spending by category using a library like Chart.js or vanilla JavaScript with the <canvas> element. 

Learning Outcomes 
	• Practice form handling in JavaScript. 
	• Implement basic data calculations dynamically. 
	• Use tables and charts for data visualization. 
	• Make use of responsive design principles with CSS.
